== You will need to reboot the system in order to put the changes into effect.

After executing reboot, the session in the `centos` tab will end.
Refresh the `centos` tab until you are reconnected.

With the convert2rhel utility running, the system will now replace the
CentOS signed packages with Red Hat signed versions. The system will
reboot a few times: first to boot into a temporary environment from
which to make these changes, a second time to perform a relabel on
SELinux contexts, and a final time in order to boot into the newly
created RHEL environment.

== Verifying the upgrade

Now that you are connected into your new RHEL system, you should verify
your results:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----

Verify that the necessary Red Hat repositories are enabled. Also, note
that none of the old CentOS repos are available:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
yum repolist
----

Now you can review the logs from the conversion itself:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
less /var/log/convert2rhel/convert2rhel.log
----
