== Understanding the Convert2RHEL command

There are several different combinations of arguments that can be used to execute the conversion process. The main factor is registering your new RHEL system with an active subscription. Your choices are:

. *Fully interactive session.* Answer questions and input username and password as part of the conversion

. *Including your username and password in the convert2rhel command.* This is less desireable since your Red Hat customer portal credentials would then be stored in the server’s Bash history in plain text.

. *Including your organization ID and Activation Key as part of the command.* This is more secure, however, finding your org-id and creating an activation key are outside the scope of this lab.

== Running the Convert2RHEL analyze utility

In order to automate this process as much as possible, you will kick off the conversion analysis using the activation key combination from #3 above:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
convert2rhel analyze --org 12451665 --activationkey convert2rhel
----

NOTE: This process will take some time!

You’ll be asked to confirm several the process at several steps. Type a `y` and hit enter to continue the process.

.Output
[source,text]
----
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Description: The loaded kernel version mismatch the latest one available in system repositories
Diagnosis: The version of the loaded kernel is different from the latest version in system repositories.
Latest kernel version available in updates: 3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7
Loaded kernel version: 3.10.0-1160.102.1.el7
Remediations: To proceed with the conversion, update the kernel version by executing the following step:

1. yum install kernel-3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7 -y
2. reboot
If you wish to ignore this message, set the environment variable 'CONVERT2RHEL_SKIP_KERNEL_CURRENCY_CHECK' to 1.

== Reviewing the analysis

When the analysis process is complete, you will noticed a couple of errors. The `Error` refers to an out of date kernel. This is listed as an error and shown in red beacuse the conversion has a much higher level of risk. The report even provides you the steps needed to correct this issue.

To remediate this issue, enter the following command:

.Command
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
yum update -y && reboot
----

.Output
[source,text]
----
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
Installing:
 kernel  x86_64  3.10.0-1160.119.1.el7  updates  52 M
----

IMPORTANT: The terminal will lose connection with the centos host leaving a `reconnect` button on the terminal.

.reconnect

You can reconnect the session in the by clicking the `reconnect` button until you are reconnected. The system reboot should take less than 2 minutes.

.Optional
NOTE: Once your system is back from its reboot, you may re-run the analyze command to see the results after fixing the kernel version.
