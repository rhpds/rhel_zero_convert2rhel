== You will need to reboot the system in order to put the changes into effect.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
reboot

IMPORTANT: After executing reboot, the session in the `centos` tab will end. When this happens, click the `reconnect` button as you did during the previous step until you are reconnected.

== Verifying the upgrade

Now that you are connected into your new RHEL system, you should verify your results:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----

[source,text]
----
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 7.9 (Maipo)
----

Verify that the necessary Red Hat repositories are enabled. Also, note that none of the old CentOS repos are available:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
yum repolist
----

[source,text]
----
<< OUTPUT ABRIDGED >>
repo id                           repo name                                 status
convert2rhel-for-rhel-7-rpms      Convert2RHEL for OS                       16
rhel-7-server-rpms/7Server/x86_64 Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server (RPMs)  34,484
repolist: 34,500

Now you can review the logs from the conversion itself:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
less /var/log/convert2rhel/convert2rhel.log
