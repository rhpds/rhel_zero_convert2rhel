== Installing the Convert2RHEL utility

In the previous step, you enabled the Convert2RHEL software repository.
That gave your CentOS Linux server access to the convert2rhel RPM
package and its dependencies from the Red Hat CDN. Verify that the
Convert2RHEL repo is enabled:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
yum repolist
----

[source,text]
----
yum output here
----

Now that the repository has been confirmed enabled, install the
convert2rhel utility:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
yum install -y convert2rhel
----

[source,text]
----
yum output here
----

In the next step, you will begin the conversion process.
