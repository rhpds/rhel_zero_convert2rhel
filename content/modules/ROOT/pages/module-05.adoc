== You will need to reboot the system in order to put the changes into effect.

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
reboot

After executing reboot, the session in the `centos` tab will end. When this happens, clic the `reconnect` button as you did during the previous steps until you are reconnected.

With the convert2rhel utility running, the system will now replace the CentOS signed packages with Red Hat signed versions.

The system will reboot three times:

1. First to boot into a temporary environment from which to make these changes.
2. Second to perform a relabel on SELinux contexts.
3. Final to boot into the newly created RHEL environment.

== Verifying the upgrade

Now that you are connected into your new RHEL system, you should verify your results:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
cat /etc/redhat-release
----

Verify that the necessary Red Hat repositories are enabled. Also, note that none of the old CentOS repos are available:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
yum repolist
----

[source,text]
----
convert output here
----

Now you can review the logs from the conversion itself:

[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes",role=execute]
----
less /var/log/convert2rhel/convert2rhel.log
----

[source,text]
----
# less /var/log/convert2rhel/convert2rhel.log
